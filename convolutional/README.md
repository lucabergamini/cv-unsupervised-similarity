## Models

The models for feature extraction are taken either
from keras builtin models or from updated baraldilorenzo's
implementations (vgg16 and vgg19).

Features extracted from the dataset are included in the folder. 
vgg16_feats.pklz and vgg19_feats.pklz were extracted using custom models,
whereas resnet50_feats.pklz was extracted using keras implementation.
